# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Universal Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow consistent naming conventions across the project
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add comments for complex logic and business rules

### Git Workflow
- Use descriptive commit messages following conventional commits format
- Create feature branches for new development
- Keep commits atomic and focused on single changes
- Use pull requests for code review before merging
- Maintain a clean commit history

### Documentation
- Keep README.md files up to date
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Include usage examples for complex features
- Maintain inline code documentation
- Update documentation when making changes

### Testing Approach
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Maintain good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Organize tests logically by feature or module
- Run tests before committing changes

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate input data and sanitize outputs
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated

## Project Structure Guidelines

### File Organization
- Group related files in logical directories
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions
- Separate source code from configuration files
- Keep build artifacts out of version control
- Organize assets and resources appropriately

### Configuration Management
- Use configuration files for environment-specific settings
- Centralize configuration in dedicated files
- Use environment variables for sensitive or environment-specific data
- Document configuration options and their purposes
- Provide example configuration files

## Development Workflow

### Before Starting Work
1. Pull latest changes from main branch
2. Create a new feature branch
3. Review existing code and architecture
4. Plan the implementation approach

### During Development
1. Make incremental commits with clear messages
2. Run tests frequently to catch issues early
3. Follow established coding standards
4. Update documentation as needed

### Before Submitting
1. Run full test suite
2. Check code quality and formatting
3. Update documentation if necessary
4. Create clear pull request description

## Common Patterns

### Error Handling
- Use appropriate error handling mechanisms for the language
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

### Performance Considerations
- Profile code for performance bottlenecks
- Optimize database queries and API calls
- Use caching where appropriate
- Consider memory usage and resource management
- Monitor and measure performance metrics

### Code Reusability
- Extract common functionality into reusable modules
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Create utility functions for repeated operations
- Design interfaces for extensibility
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
